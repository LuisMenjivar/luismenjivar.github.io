##About Me
Web developer who recognizes the importance of keeping up with the ever evolving world web. I have been programming as a hobby for the past seven years and creating web applications using Ruby for almost a year.  At work I evaluate my performance daily and seek feedback from others so that I can find ways in which to improve. I have consistently exceeded my previous employer's expectations.
